## grid usage

### settings page

### track page

## random tips:

bottom row is always the toolbar: pause, mutes for tracks 1-4, lock all, clear all, select tracks 1-4, and settings page.

hold button 3 to see the midi notes in the sequence for the current track

on the settings page, the eight buttons in rows 5-6, cols 13-16 are currently unassigned, but for now you can hit any of them to resync all of the sequences
